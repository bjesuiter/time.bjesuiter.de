The .beans directory contains 70+ bean files that should be cleaned up.

## Issues
- Large number of beans in the directory
- Completed beans accumulate over time
- Makes beans directory harder to navigate

## Checklist
- [ ] Review all beans in .beans/ directory
- [ ] Archive beans that are marked as 'completed' or 'scrapped'
- [ ] Keep only active and relevant beans
- [ ] Consider setting up a cleanup script or process
- [ ] Document bean archival process in AGENTS.md if needed
