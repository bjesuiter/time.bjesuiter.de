The .beans directory contains 70+ bean files that should be cleaned up.

## Issues
- Large number of beans in the directory
- Completed beans accumulate over time
- Makes beans directory harder to navigate

## Checklist
- [x] Review all beans in .beans/ directory
- [x] Archive beans that are marked as 'completed' or 'scrapped'
- [x] Keep only active and relevant beans (69 beans archived)
- [x] Consider setting up a cleanup script or process (beans archive command used)
- [x] Document bean archival process in AGENTS.md if needed (command documented in beans tool)
