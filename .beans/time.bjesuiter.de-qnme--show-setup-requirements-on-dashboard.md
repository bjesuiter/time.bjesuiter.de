If the application requires setup (e.g., missing environment variables, unconfigured services, or initial configuration), display this information prominently on the dashboard site so users know what steps they need to take.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detect when setup is incomplete (missing env vars, no admin user, etc.)
- [ ] Display a clear setup status/checklist on the dashboard
- [ ] Guide users through required setup steps
- [ ] Hide setup prompts once configuration is complete
