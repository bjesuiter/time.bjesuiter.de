Implement improved navigation arrows for week view using the following pattern:

- `>` = +1 Week  
- `>>` = goto next month  
- `<` = -1 Week  
- `<<` = goto previous month

## Checklist
- [ ] Design and implement the new navigation arrow components
- [ ] Add tooltip labels to clarify each arrow's function
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts if applicable
- [ ] Test navigation behavior for edge cases (week boundaries, month transitions)
