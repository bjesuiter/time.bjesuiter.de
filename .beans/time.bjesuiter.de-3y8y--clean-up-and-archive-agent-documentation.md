The agent/ directory contains many markdown files that may need cleanup or archiving.

## Files Found
- 18 files in agent/decisions/ (including 2025 and 2026 dated files)
- 18 files in agent/summaries/ (various research docs)
- These are likely historical artifacts from AI agent sessions

## Issues
- Large number of markdown files cluttering the repository
- Some files may be outdated or superseded by later decisions
- Makes it harder to navigate the codebase

## Checklist
- [ ] Review agent/decisions/ files for outdated decisions
- [ ] Archive old decisions that are no longer relevant
- [ ] Review agent/summaries/ for consolidation opportunities
- [ ] Create a clean structure or archive old docs
- [ ] Update README or AGENTS.md if documentation structure changes
