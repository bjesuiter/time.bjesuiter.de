Make all pages work well on mobile devices (minimum 375px width). Focus on:
- Dashboard with WeeklyTimeTable  
- WeekSelector and MonthNavigation
- OvertimeSummary and CumulativeOvertimeSummary
- Settings page with forms

Use Tailwind responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:) for:
- Smaller text on mobile
- Stack elements vertically on mobile  
- Horizontal scroll wrapper for tables
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px tap targets)
- Full-width inputs on mobile
