Currently the 'last updated' indicator only shows time (HH:MM). Add the date as well for clarity, especially when viewing data that was fetched on a previous day.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Show date and time (e.g., 'Jan 20, 14:30' or '20.01. 14:30')
- Keep it compact to fit in the header area
- Consider relative formatting for recent times (e.g., 'Today 14:30' vs 'Yesterday 14:30')
