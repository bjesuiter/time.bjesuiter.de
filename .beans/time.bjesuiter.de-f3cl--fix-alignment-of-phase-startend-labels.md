The 'Phase Start' and 'Phase End' labels are misaligned.

## Fix
Make the icon into one grid row and the text in the second row to fix the alignment issue.

## Checklist
- [ ] Locate the component rendering Phase Start/End labels
- [ ] Restructure layout: icon in first grid row, text in second row
- [ ] Verify alignment is fixed visually
