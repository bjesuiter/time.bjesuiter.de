# Research Summary: EventSourcingDB vs SQLite

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: ? Research Complete

## TL;DR - Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: Continue with SQLite + Drizzle ORM. Do NOT adopt EventSourcingDB.**

Your current architecture is exactly right. EventSourcingDB is the wrong tool for your application.

---

## Quick Answers to Your Questions

### 1. Should I use EventSourcingDB instead of SQLite?

**NO.** EventSourcingDB is:
- A separate database server (Docker container, HTTP API)
- Built for event sourcing patterns your app doesn't use
- Brand new (released 2025, v1.5.0, only 26 GitHub stars)
- Incompatible with Better-auth and Drizzle ORM
- Adds massive complexity without any benefits

### 2. Do I need both SQLite and EventSourcingDB?

**NO.** Using both would be a mistake:
- Two databases to maintain
- Data synchronization issues
- Doubled operational complexity
- No clear source of truth

There's no scenario where using both makes sense.

### 3. What are the pros and cons?

**SQLite + Drizzle: Perfect for your application**
- ? Embedded (zero operational overhead)
- ? Temporal tables solve your versioning needs perfectly
- ? Fast, mature, battle-tested (23+ years)
- ? Works with Better-auth and TanStack Query
- ? Simple, well-documented, large community

**EventSourcingDB: Wrong tool for this job**
- ? Separate service (Docker, HTTP API, monitoring)
- ? Your app doesn't generate domain events
- ? Brand new, unproven (< 1 year old)
- ? Incompatible with your stack
- ? Solves problems you don't have

## Why Your Current Architecture is Correct

Your temporal configuration table (`config_chronic`) is a well-known, proven pattern:

```typescript
{
  validFrom: timestamp,      // When this config became active
  validUntil: timestamp | null, // null = current config
}
```

This is called **Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2** and is used by:
- Data warehouses
- Audit systems
- Configuration management systems
- Any system needing historical tracking

**You're already using the right pattern.**

---

## What is EventSourcingDB?

EventSourcingDB is a **separate standalone database server** (like PostgreSQL) designed exclusively for event sourcing:

- Runs as Docker container
- HTTP API (not SQL)
- CloudEvents format required
- Built for append-only event logs
- Requires API token authentication

**It's fundamentally different from SQLite** - not a replacement, a completely different architecture.

---

## Why EventSourcingDB Doesn't Fit Your Use Case

Your application:
- ? Doesn't generate domain events
- ? Consumes data from Clockify API (external source)
- ? Doesn't have event-driven workflows
- ? Doesn't need event replay
- ? Doesn't need CQRS patterns
- ? Has simple state changes (just new config values)

Event sourcing is for applications with:
- ? Financial transactions (immutable events)
- ? Complex domain logic with state machines
- ? Event-driven microservices
- ? Audit trail requirements
- ? Need to replay events for testing/recovery

**Your time tracking app needs NONE of these.**

## Comparison Summary

| Aspect | SQLite + Drizzle | EventSourcingDB |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Deployment** | Single file, embedded | Separate Docker container |
| **Integration** | Works with Better-auth, Drizzle | Incompatible |
| **Maturity** | 23+ years, rock solid | < 1 year old, v1.5.0 |
| **Operations** | Zero overhead | Docker, monitoring, backups |
| **Queries** | SQL (powerful, fast) | EventQL (limited) + event replay |
| **Your use case fit** | Perfect | Wrong abstraction |
| **Learning curve** | Low (standard SQL) | High (event sourcing paradigm) |
| **Community** | Massive | Tiny (26 stars) |

## Next Steps

1. ? Close the research TODOs (already done in ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. ? Continue with SQLite + Drizzle ORM
3. ? Implement temporal configuration table as planned
4. ? Use timestamp-based cache invalidation
5. ? Move forward with confidence - your architecture is correct!

---

## Final Verdict

**Your intuition was correct to question whether EventSourcingDB was needed.**

Your current plan with SQLite + temporal tables is:
- ? Simpler
- ? Faster
- ? More maintainable
- ? Better fit for your use case
- ? Less risky (mature vs brand new)
- ? Zero operational overhead

**Don't overthink it. Your architecture is solid.**
